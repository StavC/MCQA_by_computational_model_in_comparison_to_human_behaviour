# Paragraph

Adv: Duran was arrested in Spain in 2009, on charges brought against him by six of the 39 banks that had lent him money.

His actions, he said, were in the vanguard of a worldwide debate on the economic crisis. <D3><A2><D1>The timing pushed the anti-capitalist movement into the light,</D1></A2></D3> <D2>just as many Spaniards were seeking alternatives to a system that had wreaked havoc on their lives.</D2>

# Paragraph

Adv: While the same actions would probably be better understood in today’s Spain, he said that they would not be needed. <D3><D2><D1>The anti-capitalist movement has grown from a fringe movement to one supported by thousands of Spaniards, he said, evidenced by the widely supported movements such as the Indignados.</D1></D2></D3> Duran is widening his focus to include Spain’s justice system, by promoting restorative justice. “The people in Spain who believe that banks don’t work, they think that I don’t owe anything. I’ve already done my work,” he said. “But there is a part of a population that is not in agreement with us and I think I should respond to that.” <A3><A2><A1>In his case, he said, the element of reciprocity he could offer to banks might lie in the insight he gleaned from years of obtaining bank loans fraudulently.</A2></A3> He could share his thoughts on “which best practices work and the bad ones that don’t,” he suggested, “for the general population and for bank workers”.</A1>
