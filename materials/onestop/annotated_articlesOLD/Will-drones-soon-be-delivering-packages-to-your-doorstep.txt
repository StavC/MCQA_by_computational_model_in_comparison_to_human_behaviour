Will drones soon be delivering packages to your doorstep


# Paragraph

Adv: <A3><A1>How far away are we from a world where drones deliver packages? If Amazon is to be believed, not far at all. Others are not so sure: technical progress past this point isn’t merely a matter of invention; it’s a matter of public safety.</A1></A3> Paul Misener, Amazon’s vice-president of global public policy, told a congressional hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place. The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) will finally have regulations governing the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016. <D3><D2><D1>But the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines aren’t airway-legal at all yet – only drones up to 25kg will be covered</D1></D2></D3> and <A2>the FAA points out in the proposed rules that, if you’re going to crowd the skies with radio-controlled flying robots, they had better all be using different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack.</A2> 

Int: <A3><A1>Will we soon live in a world where drones deliver packages? If you believe Amazon, the answer is “yes”. Others are not so sure: we need to make more technical progress in this area but there is also the problem of public safety.</A1></A3> Amazon spokesman Paul Misener told a US congress hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place. The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) will finally have regulations on the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016. <D3><D2><D1>But the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines aren’t legal yet – only drones up to 25kg will be legal.</D1></D2></D3> <A2>And the FAA says that, if you’re going to crowd the skies with radio-controlled flying robots, they must all use different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack.</A2>

Ele: <A3><A1>One day, drones could deliver packages to your home. When will this happen? If you believe Amazon, it will be soon. Other people are not so sure. They have to invent the right technology but, also, they have to consider public safety.</A1></A3> Amazon say that they will be ready as soon as the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) introduce rules for using drones. The FAA will finally introduce rules for using unmanned aircraft by June 2016. <D3><D2><D1>But the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines aren’t legal yet – only drones up to 25kg will be legal.</D1></D2></D3> <A2>And the FAA says in the rules they want to introduce that drones will all have to use different radio frequencies that nobody can block or hijack.</A2>

Adv: Professor Sajiv Singh of Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute, who runs a “critical cargo delivery” company called NearEarth, said that <D3><D1>piloting a state-of-the-art drone was a little more like leaving it a trail of breadcrumbs:</D1> go to this altitude, perform this short task, go back home.</D3> But even short flights from a mobile landing pad pose serious logistical problems, he said. <A1>“They’re not proposing to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; <A3>they’re proposing to deliver from a warehouse to where the consumer is,</A3> which is likely an urban area or a suburban area,” he said. “In those particular cases, <D2>there are going to be hazards along the way that the vehicle is going to have to detect.</D2> Maybe there will be terrain that the map doesn’t know about, unless you’ve mapped that exact route before. Even then, maybe there’s construction equipment that wasn’t there but is there now. Maybe GPS signals are blocked or partially blocked, in which case it’s going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.”</A1> <A2>All this is surmountable, he said – but it’s difficult.</A2>

Int: Professor Sajiv Singh, who runs a cargo delivery company called NearEarth, said that, <D3><D1>to pilot a state-of-the-art drone, you simply give it some basic instructions:</D1> go to this altitude, perform this short task, go back home.</D3> But even short flights from a mobile landing pad could cause serious logistical problems, he said. <A1>“They’re not going to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; <A3>they’re going to deliver from a warehouse to the consumer,</A3> which will probably be an urban area or a suburban area,” he said. “In those particular cases, <D2>there are going to be hazards that the vehicle is going to have to see.</D2> Maybe there will be terrain that the map doesn’t know about. Then, maybe there’s construction equipment that wasn’t there before but is there now. Maybe GPS signals are blocked, in which case it’s going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.”</A1> <A2>All these problems can be solved, he said – but it’s difficult.</A2>

Ele: Professor Sajiv Singh, who works for delivery company NearEarth, said that <D3><D1>flying drones is quite simple – you just give it some basic instructions:</D1> go to this height, do this short task, go back home.</D3> But even short flights from a mobile landing place could cause serious problems, he said. <A1>“They’re not planning to deliver in areas where nobody lives; <A3>they’re planning to deliver from a warehouse to the consumer,</A3> which will probably be in a town or city,” he said. <D2>“The drone will have to see hazards.</D2> Maybe there will be things that the map doesn’t know about. Maybe there will be construction equipment that wasn’t there but is there now. Maybe GPS signals will be blocked so it’s going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.”</A1> <A2>All this can be solved, he said – but it’s difficult.</A2>

Q: Why is drone delivery in populated areas difficult?
a: There will be too many dangers that the drone may not be able to handle

Adv:  <D1>One major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks.</D1> <D3><D2><A1>“If you have an off-the-shelf UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle], it’ll just keep going and crash into the ground,”</A1> said roboticist Daniel Huber.</D2></D3> “Technologically, most of the things that are needed for this are in place,” said Huber. <A3><A2>He is working on a program that proposes using drones to inspect infrastructure – pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on. “We’ve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and it’ll autonomously fly around that area and look at every surface and then report back.”</A2></A3>

Adv: Huber, a senior scientist at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, where he works on 3D systems imagery, said with respect to a program like Amazon’s: “I have heard them say that many packages are lightweight – a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes. If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that base. <A3><D2><A1>You need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have about that distance.” It’s one way, he said, of making sure the surrounding population is relatively safe. “The larger you get, the more dangerous you get.”</A1></D2></A3>  <A2><D3><D1>Of course, safety remains a major concern – Singh points out that, for a commercial aircraft to be considered skyworthy, it has to prove a rate of one serious failure every 1m hours.</D1></D3> Drones, he said, are “one or two orders of magnitude away” from that benchmark. “The Reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours,” Singh said. An oil leak, by the way, doesn’t count as catastrophic failure – something has to fall out of the sky. “We’re closing the gap,” Singh said. “There’s a lot of interest.”</A2>

Int: Huber, who works on 3D systems imagery, said about Amazon: “I have heard them say that many packages are lightweight – a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes.

But they don’t consider an oil leak a catastrophic failure – something has to fall out of the sky.</A2>

If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that vehicle. <A3><D2><A1>You need a 15-minute distance, and typical drones have about that distance.” It’s one way, he said, to make sure people are safe. “The larger the distance, the more dangerous it becomes.”</A1></D2></A3> <A2><D3><D1>Of course, safety is still a big worry – Singh points out that for a passenger airplane to be allowed to fly, it can only have one serious failure every one million hours.</D1></D3> Drones, he said, are much less safe. “The Reaper drone, for example, has one failure in 10,000 hours,” Singh said.</A2>

Q: What happens as you increase the distance the drone travels?
a: It becomes more dangerous
b: People are safer
c: There are more serious failures every one million hours
d: The package takes longer to be delivered

Q: How do you measure the safety of any flying aircraft according to the article?
a: The frequency of serious failures
b: Whether or not it has a failure every 10,000 hours
c: The distance it flies without an accident
d: The number of failures throughout its lifetime

Q1: What is the typical distance for a drone to travel?
a: A 15-minute distance
b: Any distance that is considered safe
c: A one million hour distance
d: Anywhere for 40 to 60 miles

# Paragraph

Adv: Part of this is simply that air travel is inherently dangerous and, thus, standards are much higher. <D3><D2><D1>“If you fly commercial airlines, often they’ll say, ’Oh, a component has failed – we have to go back to the gate,’”</D1></D2></D3> Singh said. “And that’s an established industry with 60 years of legacy! <A1>I shudder to think that one of these things might come down on a crowded highway.”</A1> <A3><A2>Part of the solution, Singh said, is simple contingency planning: “If things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.”</A2></A3>

Int: Part of the reason for this is that air travel is dangerous so standards are much higher. <D3><D2><D1>“If you fly commercial airlines, they often say, ‘Oh, a component has failed – we have to go back to the gate,’”</D1></D2></D3> Singh said. “And that’s an established industry with 60 years of legacy! <A1>I hate to think that a drone might come down on a busy road.”</A1> <A3><A2>Part of the solution, Singh said, is planning for every situation: “If things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.”</A2></A3>

Ele: Part of the reason for this is simply that air travel is dangerous so standards are much higher. <D3><D2><D1>“If you fly a passenger airplane, often they will say, ‘Oh, a small part isn’t working; we have to go back,’”</D1></D2></D3> Singh said. “And people have been flying passenger airplanes for 60 years! <A1>I hate to think that a drone might come down on a busy road.”</A1> <A3><A2>Part of the solution, Singh said, is planning for every situation: “If things fail, the drone has to do something sensible.”</A2></A3>
