Google Introduces its Driverless Car


# Paragraph

Adv: Unveiling a car with a top speed of 25mph, two seats and <D2>no pedals or steering wheel</D2> <A3><A1>might not make much of an impression at a motor show. But Google, in the US, sent a minor earthquake through the car and taxi industries as it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car.</A1></A3> The electrically powered vehicle, which Google has begun testing around its headquarters in Mountain View, California, dispenses with all the normal controls,<A2> including foot pedals. Instead, it has a smartphone app that summons it and tells it the destination, and a single STOP button</A2> mounted between the two front-facing seats in case the occupants need to <D3><D1>override the computer.</D1></D3>

# Paragraph

Adv: The car, in fact, takes over all the tasks of navigation, steering, acceleration and braking. The company is building about 100 prototypes for a two-year test. <D2>The company’s co-founder, Sergey Brin, told a conference in California that the vehicle was “still in the prototype stage” but that <A3><A1>the project was “about changing the world for people who are not well served by transportation today.”</A1></D2></A3> He said of the car: “You’re just sitting there; no steering wheel, no pedals. <D3><A2><D1>For me, it was very relaxing.</D1></D3> About ten seconds after getting in, I forgot I was there. It reminded me of catching a chairlift by yourself – a bit of solitude I found really enjoyable.”</A2>

# Paragraph

Adv: <A1>Google says that the principal aim of the project is to improve safety and that, because the car is <D3><D2>constructed with impact-absorbing foam at the front</D2></D3> and a plastic windscreen, “it should be far safer than any other car for pedestrians”.</A1> <D1>The cars, which have been built specially by a company (as yet unnamed) in Detroit,</D1> will be used to investigate further how best to make driverless vehicles work. <A3><A2>Google will run a pilot programme using the cars, which are not yet for sale.</A2></A3>

# Paragraph

Adv: <A3><A1>One challenge is creating high-definition scans of the roads and surroundings <D2>before the cars can drive along them</D2> because they cannot gather and process enough information in real time.</A1></A3> So far, <D3><D1>there are high-detail maps of about 2,000 miles of California’s roads, but the state has more than 170,000 miles of public roads.</D1></D3> <A2>Google says it is interested in licensing the technology to traditional vehicle manufacturers once it has refined it sufficiently.</A2> Members of the team had been working on the project even before joining Google, for more than a decade.

# Paragraph

Adv: However, Steve McNamara, general secretary of the 10,500-strong London Taxi Drivers’ Association, said: “You won’t get these driverless cars in London for 20 or 25 years. Maybe, by then, they’ll have a charge point – because there isn’t a single one in London now.” <A3><A1><D2>Other car makers, including Volvo, Ford and Mercedes, are working on driver-assisted vehicles, which, unlike Google’s version, do not dispense with the driver controls.</D2></A1> But Chris Urmson, director of the self-driving car project at Google, said that <A2>the new prototypes dispensed with the steering wheel and brakes</A3> because there was no guarantee that a human occupant would be able to take over in an emergency, and that it was <D3><D1>simpler just to have an emergency stop button.</D1></A2></D3>

Adv: Urmson said: “The vehicles will be very basic. We want to learn from them and adapt them as quickly as possible. <A1>But they will take you where you want to go at the push of a button.</A1> And, that’s an important step towards improving road safety and transforming mobility for millions of people.” <A3><A2>So far, the Google versions of the self-driving cars have covered 700,000 miles without an accident caused by the computer. The company points out that thousands of people die each year on the roads</A2></A3> and that <D3><D2><D1>about 80% of crashes can be ascribed to human error.</D1></D2></D3> But, they could have some way to go to match Conyon at the National Taxi Association. Aged 79, he has been driving a taxi for 50 years and claims never to have had an accident.
