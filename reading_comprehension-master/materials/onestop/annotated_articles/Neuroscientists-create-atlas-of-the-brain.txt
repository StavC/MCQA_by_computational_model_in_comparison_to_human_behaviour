Neuroscientist create atlas of the brain


# Paragraph

Adv: Scientists have created an <D3><D2><D1>“atlas of the brain” that reveals how the meanings of words are arranged across different regions of the organ.</D1></D2></D3> Like a colorful quilt laid over the cortex, <A3><A1>the atlas displays in rainbow hues how individual words and the concepts they convey can be grouped together in clumps of white matter.</A1></A3> <A2>“Our goal was to build a giant atlas that shows how one specific aspect of language is represented in the brain, in this case semantics or the meanings of words,”</A2> said Jack Gallant, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley.

# Paragraph

Adv: No single brain region holds one word or concept. <D1>A single brain spot is associated with a number of related words.</D1> <A1>And, each single word lights up many different brain spots. Together, they make up networks that represent the meanings of each word we use:</A1> life and love, death and taxes, clouds, Florida and bra. All light up their own networks. Described as a “tour de force” by one researcher who was not involved in the study, the atlas demonstrates how modern imaging can transform our knowledge of how the brain performs some of its most important tasks. With further advances, the technology could have a profound impact on medicine and other fields. <A3><A2>“It is possible that this approach could be used to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking,” said Alexander Huth, the first author on the study.</A2></A3> <D3><D2>One potential use would be a language decoder that could allow people silenced by motor neurone disease or locked-in syndrome to speak through a computer.</D2></D3>

The atlas was described as a great achievement by one researcher who was not involved in the study.

Ele: No single brain region contains one word or idea. <D1>A single brain spot contains a number of related words.</D1> <A1>And, each single word appears in many different brain spots. Together, they form networks that represent the meanings of each word we use:</A1> life and love, death and taxes. All have their own networks. The atlas shows how modern imaging can completely change what we know about how the brain does some of its most important tasks. With further work, the technology could have an enormous effect on medicine and other areas of study. <A3><A2>“It is possible that we could use this technology to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking,” said Alexander Huth, the main author of the study.</A2></A3> <D3><D2>One possible use would be a language decoder that could allow people who can’t talk, because they have a serious illness, to speak through a computer.</D2></D3>

# Paragraph

Adv: <A3><A1>To create the atlas, the scientists recorded people’s brain activity while they listened to stories read out on The Moth Radio Hour, a US radio show. They then matched the transcripts of the stories with the brain activity data to show how groups of related words triggered neural responses in 50,000 to 80,000 pea-sized spots all over the cerebral cortex.</A1></A3> <D3><D1><A2>Huth used stories from The Moth Radio Hour because they are short and compelling. The more enthralling the stories, the more confident the scientists could be that the people being scanned were focusing on the words and not drifting off.</A2></D1></D3> Seven people listened to two hours of stories each. <D2>Per person, that amounted to hearing roughly 25,000 words – and more than 3,000 different words – as they lay in the scanner.</D2>

Q: How did the scientists create the atlas?
a: They matched the listened words to brain activity
b: They recorded brain activity as people listened to songs

b: Exactly 60,000 responses
c: It is unknown because people drifted off during the experiment
d: 100 responses were produced per word

# Paragraph

Adv: The atlas shows how words and related terms exercise the same regions of the brain. <A3><D2><A1>For example, on the left-hand side of the brain, above the ear, is one of the tiny regions that represents the word “victim”. The same region responds to “killed”, “convicted”, “murdered” and “confessed”. On the brain’s right-hand side, near the top of the head, is one of the brain spots activated by family terms: “wife”, “husband”, “children”, “parents”.</A1></D2></A3> <A2>Each word is represented by more than one spot because words tend to have several meanings. <D3><D1>One part of the brain, for example, reliably responds to the word “top”, along with other words that describe clothing.</D1></D3> But, the word “top” activates many other regions. One of them responds to numbers and measurements, another to buildings and places.</A2> The scientists have created an interactive website where the public can explore the brain atlas.

Adv: <A3><A1>Strikingly, the brain atlases were similar for all the participants, suggesting that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way. <D2>The scientists only scanned five men and two women, however.</D2> All are native English speakers and two are authors of the study published in Nature.</A1></A3> <D3><D1>It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different semantic brain atlases.</D1></D3> Lorraine Tyler, a cognitive neuroscientist and head of the Center for Speech, Language and the Brain at Cambridge University, said the research was a “tour de force in its scope and methods”. <A2>But, the brain atlas in its current form does not capture fine differences in word meanings.</A2> “While this research is path-breaking in its scope, there is still a lot to learn about how semantics is represented in the brain.”

a: Native English speakers organize word meanings the same way
b: Different genders organize word meanings the same way
