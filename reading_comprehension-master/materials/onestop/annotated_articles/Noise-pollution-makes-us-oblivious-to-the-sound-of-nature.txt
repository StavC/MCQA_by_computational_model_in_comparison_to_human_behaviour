Noise pollution makes us oblivious to the sound of nature


# Paragraph

Adv: The tranquil chorus of the natural world is in danger of being lost to today’s generation as people screen out the noises that surround them, a senior US researcher warns. <A1>Rising levels of background noise in some areas threaten to make people oblivious to the uplifting sounds of birdsong, trickling water and trees rustling in the wind,</A1> <D1>which can often be heard even in urban centres,</D1> said Kurt Fristrup, a senior scientist at the US National Park Service. <A3><A2>The problem was exacerbated by people listening to music through their earphones instead of tuning in to the birds and other sounds of nature</A2></A3> <D3><D2>that can easily be drowned out by traffic, music and other noises, he said.</D2></D3>

Adv: “This learned deafness is a real issue,” Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose. <D3><D2><D1>“We are conditioning ourselves to ignore the information coming into our ears.”</D1></D2></D3> <A1>“This gift that we are born with – to reach out and hear things hundreds of metres away, all these incredible sounds – is in danger of being lost through a generational amnesia,”</A1> he said. <A3><A2>“There is a real danger, both of loss of auditory acuity, where we are exposed to noise for so long that we stop listening,</A2></A3> but also a loss of listening habits, where we lose the ability to engage with the environment the way we were built to,” he added.

# Paragraph

Adv: <A1><D2>For the past ten years, the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 sites across the US,</D2> including Yosemite in California, Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska. Not one was unaffected by some form of noise from human activity, be it over-flying aircraft, motorbikes, motorboats or tour buses.</A1> Fristrup’s team combined the sound levels recorded from national parks with similar data from urban settings to create a model of noise levels across the US.  <D1><A2>They predict that noise pollution is growing faster than the US population and more than doubles every 30 years.</A2></D1>

Adv: “It’s not surprising people are putting on earphones or even noise cancelling headphones to try and create a quieter or more congenial environment,” he said. <D3><A1><D2>“As you raise background sound levels, it has the same effect on your hearing that fog would have on your vision.</D2></D3> Instead of having this expansive experience of all the sounds around you, you are aware of only a small area around you,”</A1> he said. <A3><D1><A2>“Even in most of our cities, there are birds and things to appreciate in the environment, and there can be very rich natural choruses to pay attention to.</A2></D1></A3> And that is being lost.”

Adv: The warning came as other scientists reported beneficial health effects from listening to natural sounds. <A1>Speaking at the same meeting, Derrick Taff, a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University, described preliminary experiments which suggest that listening to recordings from national parks, of waterfalls, birdsong and wind, helped people recover from stressful events.</A1> <A3><D1><A2>“We know that natural sounds are very important to people.

My advice is to go to your protected areas and experience what you are missing.”
