# Paragraph

Adv: “Our study shows that oxytocin affects the brain and opens up the possibility that, when combined with behavioral treatments, it works like a social enhancer,” he said. <D3><D1><D2>The scientists used a technique called functional MRI to scan the brains of 17 youths aged eight to 16 with autism while they looked at images of cars or the eyes of people expressing various emotions.</D2></D1></D3> <A1>The scans were given 45 minutes after the participants inhaled a placebo or oxytocin through a nasal spray.</A1> <A3><A2>The scans showed that reward circuitry in the children’s brains behaved more normally after a snort of oxytocin, being more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when viewing the inanimate cars.</A2></A3> The study appears in the latest issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States.

Adv: <D2>“If this is replicated, it suggests that oxytocin might treat something for which we don’t have a treatment in autism, and that’s the core social motivation,”</D2> Pelphrey told the Guardian. <A3><A1>He warned that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for the social difficulties caused by autism</A1></A3> and <D3><A2><D1>cautioned against buying oxytocin from suppliers online.</D1></D3> “We don’t want them running out on the basis of this study or any other and trying oxytocin at home. There is no telling what they are buying. We are nowhere near thinking this is a ready treatment. It needs more follow-up,” he said.</A2> “This is an important new study in identifying changes in brain activity in key regions of the brain involved in social cognition in autism following oxytocin administration,” said Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University.

# Paragraph

Adv: A surprising finding, however, is that oxytocin nasal spray did not change performance on the social cognitive task. <A3><A1>Nor is it clear yet if oxytocin only has benefits for people with autism or has any unwanted side effects.</A1></A3> <D3><D1><A2>Finally, oxytocin effects only last about 45 minutes, so there may be practical considerations as to whether this could be used as a treatment.</A2></D1></D3> <D2>“From a scientific perspective, this study has a lot of evidence from animal and human work to justify serious attention, but more research is needed.</D2> Doctors should be cautious about the clinical potential of this hormone until we know much more about its benefits and risks, in much larger studies,” said Simon Baron-Cohen.

Adv: Uta Frith, who studies autism at University College London, said: <D3><A1><D2>“According to this study, oxytocin may have the effect of making faces more interesting</D2></D3> as assessed by greater activity in brain structures concerned with reward evaluation. <A3><A2>Disappointingly, this effect is seen only in brain activity and not in behavior.</A2></A1></A3> <D1>Demonstrating an effect on behavior will be critical if nasal spray treatment is to be of any value.”</D1>
