Adv: “I shifted towards it naturally,” he said of his becoming an expert in wealth therapy. <D1>“Many of the extremely wealthy – the 1% of the 1% – feel that their problems are really not problems.</D1> But they are. A lot of therapists do not give enough weight to their issues.” So, what issues are America’s 1% struggling with? <A1>“There is guilt over being rich in the first place,” he said. “There is the feeling that they have to hide the fact that they are rich.</A1> <D3><D2>And, then, there is the isolation – being in the 1%, it turns out, can be lonely.”</D2></D3> It seems F Scott Fitzgerald was right: the very rich “are different from you and me.” <A3><A2>Counsellors argue things have become worse since the financial crisis and the debate over income inequality that has been spurred on by movements like Occupy Wall Street and the Fight for $15 fair wage campaign.</A2></A3>

Adv: “The Occupy Wall Street movement was a good one and had some important things to say about income inequality but it singled out the 1% and painted them globally as something negative,” said Jamie Traeger-Muney, a wealth psychologist and founder of the Wealth Legacy Group. <A3><A1><D2>The media, she said, is partly to blame for making the rich “feel like they need to hide or feel ashamed”.</D2></A1></A3> <D3><A2><D1>“Sometimes, I am shocked by things that people say.</D1></D3> You would never refer to another group of people in the way that it seems perfectly normal to refer to wealth holders.”</A2>

Adv: “It’s really isolating to have a lot of money.
