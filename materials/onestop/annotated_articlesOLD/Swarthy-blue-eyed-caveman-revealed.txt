Adv: The invention of farming brought humans and animals into much closer contact and <D2>humans likely evolved more robust immune systems to fend off infections that the animals passed on.</D2> <A3><A1>But scientists may have overestimated the impact farming had in shaping the human immune system, because tests on the hunter-gatherer’s DNA found that he already carried mutations that boost the immune system to tackle various nasty bugs.</A1></A3> <D3><D1>Some live on in modern Europeans today.</D1></D3> <A2>“Before we started this work, I had some ideas of what we were going to ﬁnd,” said Carles Lalueza-Fox, who led the study at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona. “Most of those ideas turned out to be completely wrong.”</A2>

Ele: The invention of farming brought humans and animals much closer and <D2>humans probably developed stronger immune systems to ﬁght infections from the animals.</D2> <A3><A1>But the change to humans’ immune systems may not be as big as scientists thought – tests on the hunter-gatherer ’s DNA found that he already had genes that made his immune system strong.</A1></A3> <D3><D1>Some of these genes still exist in modern Europeans today.</D1></D3> <A2>“Before we started this work, I had some ideas of what we were going to ﬁnd,” said Carles Lalueza-Fox, who led the study at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona. “Most of those ideas turned out to be completely wrong.”</A2>

b: It completely overturned the theory that farming caused humans to develop stronger immune systems
c: That modern Europeans have weak immune systems
d: That immune systems are dependant on a healthy diet

Q: What is the purpose of Lalueza-Fox’s quote in the article?
a: To indicate that the results of the study are surprising
b: To show that Lalueza-Fox was wrong
c: To show how humans developed stronger immune systems to fight infections from animals
d: To describe the Mesolithic man

Q1: What possibly incorrect assumption did scientists make about the human immune system?
a: The invention of farming largely impacted it
b: Hunter-gatherers had an average number of disease-fighting genes
c: Europeans have stronger immune systems than other populations
d: Hunter-gatherers had similar DNA to the first farmers

# Paragraph

Adv: The Spanish team started their work after a group of cavers stumbled upon two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006. <D1>The human remains, which belonged to two men in their early 30s,</D1> had been <D3><D2>extremely well preserved by the cool environment of the cave.</D2></D3> <A1>Carbon dating put the remains at around 7,000 years old, before farming had swept into Europe from the Middle East.</A1> <A3><A2>The timing ﬁtted with ancient artifacts found at the site, including perforated reindeer teeth that were strung and hung from the people’s clothing.</A2></A3>

a: They were hunter-gatherers
b: They arrived in Europe from the Middle East
c: They belonged to two 30-year-old men
d: They hunting mammoths

Q: How were reindeer teeth most likely used 7,000 years ago?

Adv: <A3><A1>On top of the scientiﬁc impact, artists might have to rethink their drawings of the people. <D2>“You see a lot of reconstructions of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin. You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eye colour,”</D2></A1></A3> Lalueza-Fox said. <A2>The Spanish team went on to compare the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related. They found that the ancient DNA most closely matched the genetic makeup of <D3><D1>people living in northern Europe, in particular Sweden and Finland.</D1></D3></A2>

Ele: <A3><A1>This discovery is important for science. It is also important to artists who will have to draw Mesolithic people in a new way. <D2>“You see a lot of pictures of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin.

Q: How will the discovery impact art about Mesolithic hunter-gatherers?
a: People will start drawing Mesolithic hunter-gatherers with dark skin and blue eyes
b: It won’t change anything - Mesolithic hunter-gatherers will still always be drawn with light skin
c: It will inspire people to draw people from northern Europe, in particular Sweden and Finland, as models for Mesolithic hunter-gatherers
d: It will cause artists to choose new styles for drawing Mesolithic hunter-gatherers

Q: How did the Spanish team compare hunter gatherers to Europeans?
a: By studying DNA to find genetic similarities
b: By tracing back ancestries to see how they were related
c: By studying their appearances and seeing who looked similar
d: By examining their diets and contrasting them

Q1: How are Mesolithic hunter-gatherers currently portrayed through art?
