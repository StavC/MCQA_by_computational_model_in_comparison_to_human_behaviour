Adv: Sadly, regular mystery shopping assignments that pay like Laura’s are few and far between. In fact, competition is so fierce, she keeps her job a closely guarded secret and even her friends and family don’t know who she works for (Laura is not her real name).[a] It’s estimated that more than 500,000 people have registered as mystery shoppers in the UK, but just 10% or less manage to get regular work each month and this has led to a dramatic reduction in compensation. <D3><D2>“Where once you got a fee, reimbursement for your purchase and mileage, you now often just receive a contribution towards a purchase,”</D2></D3> say Val, a 51-year-old former mystery shopper. “I worked for 40 different mystery shopping companies for almost 20 years but I gave up entirely three years ago because I had bills to pay and very few assignments paid what I considered to be an acceptable rate.”[b] Nowadays, mystery shopping companies mostly rely on the promise of freebies to incentivize their workers. <A1>“Marketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort,” says Boydell. “At the most, we’ll pay £15 to £25 plus reimbursement for, say, a meal for two or a hotel stay.</A1> <D1>We don’t directly employ any shoppers so we don’t have to pay them the minimum wage.”</D1> <A3><A2>“I’d go on a cruise for nothing,” says Laura. “But I think mystery shopping companies that pay you a nominal fee to travel to a restaurant and eat a meal are exploiting people.</A2></A3> I won’t touch those jobs anymore.” There are plenty of people, however, that would.
