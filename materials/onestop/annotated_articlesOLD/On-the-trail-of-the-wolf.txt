# Paragraph

Adv: Wolves are not pooches. Mysłajek says only scientific arguments – <D1>the need to regenerate forests and control the wild animal population</D1> – can save Europe’s wild carnivores, especially the unpopular wolf. <A1>“Natural predators balance the ecosystem. <D2><D3>They keep herbivores in check, thus allowing trees to grow tall for birds to nest in.”</D3></D2></A1> <A2><A3>The ban on wolf hunting in the western Carpathians came into force in 1995 and nationwide in Poland in 1998.</A3> There are now resident packs in virtually all the country’s major forests. The predators coexist with humans rather than being fenced off, as they are in African safari parks.</A2>

# Paragraph

Adv: The survival and mobility of Poland’s wolves has been helped by the country’s belated infrastructure development. In 1989, when the communists relinquished power, Poland had only one motorway. Major road projects – requiring wildlife impact studies – began after Poland joined the European Union in 2004. The country now has one of the highest densities in the world of overhead crossings and underpasses for wild animals. <A3><A1>Attitudes have also changed. <A2>“For many years, hunting was cultural. In 1975, there were fewer than 100 wolves in Poland.</A2></A1></A3> Beginning in the 1950s, hunting wolves had been encouraged by the authorities. They paid a reward for killing a wolf worth a month’s salary. It was carnage.” <D3><D2><D1>Mysłajek says the improvement in Polish wolves’ survival chances has been considerable but remains fragile. Packs are mobile across borders and hunting still goes on in neighboring Russia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Slovakia. </D1></D2></D3>

Int: Poland’s wolves have been helped by the country’s late infrastructure development. In 1989, when the communists left power, Poland had only one motorway. Major road projects began after Poland joined the European Union in 2004 and they are required to consider wild animals. <A3><A1>Attitudes have also changed. <A2>“For many years, hunting was cultural. In 1975, there were fewer than 100 wolves in Poland.</A2></A1></A3> From the 1950s, hunting wolves was encouraged by the authorities. They paid a reward for killing a wolf worth a month’s salary. It was carnage.’’ <D3><D2><D1>Myslajek says that Polish wolves are much safer now but they are not completely safe. Packs of wolves cross country borders and hunting still happens in neighboring Russia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Slovakia.</D1></D2></D3>

Ele: Poland didn’t have many big roads until recently and this has helped wolves. In 1989, when the communists left power, Poland had only one motorway. Big road projects began after Poland joined the European Union in 2004 and they now have to consider wild animals.<A3><A1> The way people think about wolves has also changed. <A2>“For many years, hunting was a part of life in Poland. In 1975, there were fewer than 100 wolves in Poland.”</A2></A1></A3> <D3><D2><D1>Mysłajek says that Polish wolves are much safer now but they are not completely safe. Packs go into neighboring countries – Russia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Slovakia – where there is still hunting.</D1></D2></D3>
